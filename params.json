{"name":"Jonx","tagline":"Yet another HTML template library","body":"# jonx\r\n\r\nJavascript natively works well with JSON, so the idea behind this module is to do UI with JSON as much as possible and finally convert to HTML as the last step.\r\n\r\nThis would allow building templates that are based purely on JSON and transforming JSON.\r\n\r\n[![NPM info](https://nodei.co/npm/jonx.png?downloads=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/jonx)\r\n\r\n[![Travis build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/Like-Falling-Leaves/jonx.png?branch=master)](\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/Like-Falling-Leaves/jonx)\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n   This is a work in progress, and some critical functionality is in the works still:\r\n* There is no browser build though there are no dependencies which would break this for the browser.\r\n* There is no ability to convert from HTML to json yet\r\n* There is no ability to transform JSON dynamically (templates).\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n    npm install jonx\r\n\r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\n   It is best to read the unit tests under test directory to understand how to use this.  The API is still under flux.\r\n\r\nHere is a complicated example which cover bulk of the interesting cases.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\njonx.json2html({\r\n      body: {\r\n        'div.header': 'First Div',\r\n        'section#main': [\r\n          {div: {\r\n            css: {background: 'black'}, $: [\r\n            {span: 'First Span'},\r\n            {span: 'Second Span'}\r\n            ]}}\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput HTML:\r\n```html\r\n<body>\r\n  <div class=\"header\">First Div</div>\r\n  <section id=\"main\">\r\n    <div style=\"background:black;\">\r\n      <span>First Span</span>\r\n      <span>Second Span</span>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </section>\r\n</body>\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
